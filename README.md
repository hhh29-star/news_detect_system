## Overview
A web interface for fake news detection using multimodal analysis (text + images). Currently a demo with simulated results.

## Features
- Interactive Gradio interface
- Model/dataset selection
- Performance metrics display
- Example inputs
- Single news verification

## How to Use
1. Install requirements: `pip install gradio`
2. Run: `python script.py`
3. Access the web interface
4. Either:
   - Select model/dataset and enter text + image
   - Use provided examples
5. View "detection" results (currently simulated)

## Technical Notes
- Placeholder detection logic (always returns "real")
- Sample models/datasets are listed but not fully implemented
- Performance stats are hardcoded                       <!-- by 韦玉雪 -->
